###Projects

####Autonomous Course

A set of instructions for a robot to travel on a square track or pattern, picking up an object such as a box in the middle of the course.

####House Autonomous

A challenge that involves traveling to different "rooms" in a "house" outlined on the floor with tape.  Line tracking sensors are used to enter rooms, execute turns, and correctly position the robot.

####Movement Header

A set of functions for basic movement.  Various methods included get input from sonar sensors, quadrature shaft encoders, line following sensors, and potentiometers.

###Other programs

####Joystick Control

Control a robot with tank style controls (two joysticks).  An added arm and claw are optional.

####Simple Autonomous

A basic autonomous program.

####Line Encoder Test

A program to demonstrate use of line sensors to drive a robot straight autonomously.
